## Nmap Scan Types

### Basic Scans
- `nmap <target>`  
  Scans the target using default settings, including the most common 1000 TCP ports.

- `nmap -sS <target>`  
  Performs a TCP SYN scan, also known as a stealth scan. It only sends SYN packets to ports, not completing the handshake, which helps evade detection by some firewalls.

### Stealth Scans
- `nmap -sS <target>`  
  Same as above, this is the default stealth scan and is often used to avoid detection.

- `nmap -sF <target>`  
  FIN scan, used to evade some firewalls. It sends a FIN flag to a closed port, which may confuse firewalls into not detecting the scan.

- `nmap -sX <target>`  
  Xmas scan, which sets the FIN, URG, and PSH flags. This can sometimes bypass firewalls or filters that ignore unusual packets.

### OS Detection
- `nmap -O <target>`  
  Detects the operating system of the target by analyzing its responses and fingerprinting techniques.

- `nmap -A <target>`  
  Performs OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute all in one.

### Version Detection
- `nmap -sV <target>`  
  Attempts to identify the version of services running on open ports by sending probes and analyzing the responses.

- `nmap -A -sV <target>`  
  OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute together in one scan.

### Script Scans
- `nmap -sC <target>`  
  Runs the default set of Nmap scripts to gather more detailed information about the target.

- `nmap --script <script_name> <target>`  
  Allows you to specify a particular Nmap script for more targeted information gathering.

### Traceroute
- `nmap --traceroute <target>`  
  Traces the route packets take to reach the target, displaying each hop along the way.

### Ping Scans
- `nmap -sn <target>`  
  Performs a ping scan to see if a host is up without performing a full port scan.

---

## Target Selection

### Single Target
- `nmap 192.168.1.1`  
  Scans a single host at IP address `192.168.1.1`.

### Multiple Targets
- `nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2`  
  Scans two specific hosts.

### IP Range
- `nmap 192.168.1.1-10`  
  Scans IPs from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.10`.

### Subnet Scan
- `nmap 192.168.1.0/24`  
  Scans all hosts in the `192.168.1.0` subnet (with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`).

### Host Discovery
- `nmap -Pn <target>`  
  Disables host discovery (assuming the target is up) and scans even if the target does not respond to pings.

---

## Service and Version Detection

### Service Detection
- `nmap -sV <target>`  
  Detects the version of services running on open ports by attempting to match them to known service banners.

### Version Detection
- `nmap -A -sV <target>`  
  Performs both OS detection and service version detection.

### Service Version Scanning
- `nmap -p <port> --version-all <target>`  
  Forces Nmap to attempt version detection on all services, even those on uncommon ports.

---

## Port Scanning

### TCP/UDP Scans
- `nmap -p 80,443 <target>`  
  Scans TCP ports `80` and `443` for web traffic.

- `nmap -p U:161,162 <target>`  
  Scans UDP ports `161` and `162` for SNMP traffic.

### Specific Port Scanning
- `nmap -p 22,80 <target>`  
  Scans ports `22` (SSH) and `80` (HTTP) on the target.

### Top Ports Scanning
- `nmap --top-ports 100 <target>`  
  Scans the top 100 most commonly open ports.

### Random Port Scanning
- `nmap -p R:1024-2048 <target>`  
  Scans a random selection of ports within the range `1024-2048`.

---

## Advanced Scanning Techniques

### OS Fingerprinting
- `nmap -O <target>`  
  Attempts to determine the target's operating system based on its network responses.

### TCP/IP Fingerprinting
- `nmap -sS -O <target>`  
  A SYN scan combined with OS detection for more accurate results.

### Scripting Engine
- `nmap --script vuln <target>`  
  Runs Nmapâ€™s vulnerability scripts to check for known vulnerabilities.

### Firewall Evasion
- `nmap -f <target>`  
  Sends fragmented packets to evade packet filters and firewalls.

- `nmap --data-length 400 <target>`  
  Sends packets with a custom data length to evade some IDS/IPS systems.

### Proxy Usage
- `nmap --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 <target>`  
  Routes the scan through a proxy server.

---

## Scan Performance

### Speed Adjustments
- `nmap -T4 <target>`  
  Sets the scan speed to "Aggressive", reducing scan time while balancing accuracy.

- `nmap -T5 <target>`  
  Uses the highest scan speed, but this can trigger alerts on most networks.

### Timing Templates
- `nmap -T3 <target>`  
  Uses the default timing template, which is balanced in terms of speed and stealth.

### Scan Delay Options
- `nmap --scan-delay 1s <target>`  
  Adds a 1-second delay between probe packets to reduce the likelihood of detection.

### Parallelism and Performance Tuning
- `nmap -P0 -p 80 <target>`  
  Skips host discovery (pings) and directly scans port `80` to save time.

---

## Output Formats

### Normal Output
- `nmap -oN output.txt <target>`  
  Saves the scan results in a human-readable format.

### XML Output
- `nmap -oX output.xml <target>`  
  Outputs scan results in XML format, useful for parsing by scripts.

### Grepable Output
- `nmap -oG output.gnmap <target>`  
  Outputs scan results in a grepable format, which is useful for filtering specific results.

### Script Kiddie Output
- `nmap -oS output.nmap <target>`  
  A simplistic output format often used for quick scans.

### HTML Output
- `nmap -oA output.html <target>`  
  Generates HTML output for visual representation of the scan results.

### Source Port and Packet Manipulation
- `nmap --source-port 53 <target>`  
  Sets the source port to `53` (DNS), often used to bypass filtering mechanisms.

### Fragmentation
- `nmap -f <target>`  
  Fragments packets into smaller pieces to avoid detection by firewalls.

### TTL (Time-to-Live) Adjustments
- `nmap --ttl 64 <target>`  
  Sets the TTL value for the scan packets to `64`, which may help avoid detection.
